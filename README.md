List five significant features of React
  1. Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM, which enables faster rendering of UI updates.

  2. Component-Based Architecture: React uses a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build reusable UI components.

  3. JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code in JavaScript.

  4. Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow, which makes it easier to debug and maintain code.

  5. Performance: React is known for its high performance due to its efficient rendering system and use of virtual DOM.

List five major advantages of react
  1. Reusability: React's component-based architecture enables developers to build reusable UI components, which reduces development time and increases code efficiency.

  2. Modularity: React allows developers to break down complex UIs into smaller, more manageable components, making it easier to maintain and update code.

  3. Performance: React's use of a virtual DOM and efficient rendering system ensures faster rendering of UI updates, which makes it suitable for large-scale applications.

  4. Flexibility: React can be used with different programming languages and frameworks, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.

  5. Large Community: React has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are many resources and tools available to help with development.

What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React?

  React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. React is owned by Facebook, but it is an open-source project.

What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them

  1. Syntax: HTML is a markup language, while JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript.

  2. Tag names: HTML uses traditional HTML tag names, while JSX uses capitalized component names.

  3. Attributes: HTML attributes are defined with quotes, while JSX attributes use curly braces.

Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?

  Browsers can't read JSX because it is not a valid syntax for HTML or JavaScript. JSX needs to be transformed into JavaScript code using a transpiler like Babel before it can be executed by the browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
